Question 1 Response: Prove that static analysis is not powerful enough.

	Running `strings` didn't provide very much useful information. The most interesting things were the inclusion of build parameters and git repo info [Screenshot1], and phrases like 'HTTP/2.0' and 'master secret' [Screenshot2] which seem to imply encrypted web traffic. So it seems like we are stuck with info we already knew/assumed, and to go further with static analysis would likely mean rebuilding the code from assembly and possibly deobfuscating manually.

Question 2 Response:

HTTP methods:
	The first HTTP packet contains a GET request
	The second HTTP packet contains a response from the server with status code "301 Moved Permanently" and specifies that the new location is `https://www.cnn.com`

	151.101.195.5

Question 3 Response: File name for screenshot that demonstrates `secretsearcher` does not use HTTP.
*** Don't forget to include the file in the Canvas submission.
