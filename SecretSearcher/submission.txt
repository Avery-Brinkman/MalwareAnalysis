Question 1 Response: Prove that static analysis is not powerful enough.

	Running `strings` didn't provide very much useful information. The most interesting things were the inclusion of build parameters and git repo info [Screenshot1], and phrases like 'HTTP/2.0' and 'master secret' [Screenshot2] which seem to imply encrypted web traffic. So it seems like we are stuck with info we already knew/assumed, and to go further with static analysis would likely mean rebuilding the code from assembly and possibly deobfuscating manually.
